        <h2>GBENGA MICHAEL</h2>
        <P>Hello! I’m Michael Gbenga, a Graphic Designer, Software Developer, and Web Designer with a year of hands-on experience. I’m passionate about creating visually compelling designs and innovative software solutions that address real-world problems.
           <br>
          <b>Experience and Skills:</b>
          <br>
          With proficiency in tools such as Adobe Photoshop, AutoCAD, and Python, I excel in both graphic design and web development. My expertise includes brand identity design, user experience (UX) design, and working with diverse industries like healthcare, education, and startups. My skill set is complemented by strong interpersonal abilities, including communication, teamwork, leadership, and problem-solving.
          <br>
          <b>Educational Background:</b>
          <br>
          I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Graphic Design at the University of Benin Republic, where I am expected to graduate in 2025. My studies focus on visual communication, digital illustration, typography, user interface design, and web design. Engaging in hands-on projects, such as designing branding materials and creating user-friendly website prototypes, has helped me build a strong portfolio and develop practical skills. I am also actively involved in [organizations], such as [design club, student council], which enriches my collaboration and community-driven project experience.
          <br>
          <b>Interests and Hobbies:</b>
          <br>
          Outside of my professional work, I have a passion for photography, hiking, and designing websites. Photography allows me to capture the beauty of everyday moments, often inspiring my design projects with fresh perspectives. Hiking provides a great escape from the daily grind and helps me recharge, while my love for web design keeps me engaged with the latest trends and technologies. I also enjoy reading about design trends and attending local art workshops, which help me stay ahead in my field.
          <br>
          <b>A Fun Fact About Me:</b>
          <br>
          One fun fact about me is that I once designed a custom skateboard deck for a local skating community event. Combining my love for graphic design, web design, and skateboarding, this project allowed me to merge three of my passions. The experience not only broadened my creative horizons but also gave me a unique perspective on how design can influence everyday life.</P>
